<h1>Pattern Matching Problems</h1>
<p>Dated: June 19, 2017</p> 
</header>
<p>In a pattern matching problem we are given a long text T and a pattern P. We are supposed
to find the number of locations of P in T and possibly report their positions. This problem
can be made more specific with a few more restrictions and conditions, which we will discuss
later. A lot of work has been done on this problem and we have many good solutions. Many of which 
I would like to discuss in the form of a series of papers as stated in the previous webpage.</p>

<p> I will discuss the problem in from the selected <q>paper's point of view</q>, so its more
of a discuss of the paper, rather than the problem.But our selection of papers will lead
us to a wholesome discussion of the topic.</p>
