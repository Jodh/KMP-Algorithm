		<h1>Pattern Matching Problems</h1>
		<p>Dated: June 19, 2017</p> 
		</header>
		<p>In a pattern matching problem we are given a long text T and a pattern P. We are supposed
		to find the number of locations of P in T and possibly report their positions. This problem
		can be made more specific with a few more restrictions and conditions, which we will discuss
		later. A lot of work has been done on this problem and we have many good solutions. Many of which 
		I would like to discuss in the form of a series of papers as stated in the previous webpage.</p>

		<p> I will discuss the problem in from the selected <q>paper's point of view</q>, so its more
		of a discuss of the paper, rather than the problem.But our selection of papers will lead
		us to a wholesome discussion of the topic.</p>

		<h1>Wisp</h1>
		<img src="wisp.png" alt="">
		<p>I am wisp. I will create one webpage everyday.</p>
		<p>After doing that, I will create a website where I read and explain some scientific papers
		I come across to help students like me. The website will have a comment 
		section and eventually forum section where these papers can and will be discussed.</p>
		<p> One paper per week or per 2 weeks, will be the goal. Initially the papers will be from 
		all branches of science and will be simple. So that they can be read and understood by the 
		layman with a high school science background.</p>
		<p> Later, the papers will mostly deal with computer science.As that is my area of interest.</p>
		<h4>Lets hope I can stand good on this promise</h4>
