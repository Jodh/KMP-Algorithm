<p>I am wisp. I will create one webpage everyday.</p>
<p>After doing that, I will create a website where I read and explain some scientific papers
I come across to help students like me. The website will have a comment 
section and eventually forum section where these papers can and will be discussed.</p>
<p> One paper per week or per 2 weeks, will be the goal. Initially the papers will be from 
all branches of science and will be simple. So that they can be read and understood by the 
layman with a high school science background.</p>
<p> Later, the papers will mostly deal with computer science.As that is my area of interest.</p>
<h4>Lets hope I can stand good on this promise</h4>
